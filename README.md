# UCLA Clubs Explorer
**Course**: STATS 418  
**Student**: Hengyuan (David) Liu  
**Quarter**: Spring 2025

This Shiny application helps UCLA students discover and explore student organizations based on their interests. The app provides interactive visualizations and search capabilities to make club discovery easier and more intuitive.

There are three URLs that can access this app:

1. Shinyapp: https://hengyuanliu.shinyapps.io/uclaclubs/
2. Google Cloud Run: https://ucla-clubs-app-980752141572.us-west1.run.app
3. My own domain: https://uclaclubs.hyl.gd.edu.kg/

## ðŸ§  API Infrastructure

This web app integrates **two custom APIs** I developed and deployed via **Google Cloud Run**. You can view the full implementation on GitHub and test them with the provided `curl` commands.

---

### KNN API Github: https://github.com/DavidLiu0619/ucla-clubs-knn-api
A fast and lightweight API using **TF-IDF** and **K-Nearest Neighbors** to find similar UCLA clubs based on keyword input.
**Test with:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ucla-clubs-knn-980752141572.us-central1.run.app/predict_clubs" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "machine learning artificial intelligence", "top": 4}'
```

### Gemini+RAG API Github: https://github.com/DavidLiu0619/ucla-clubs-rag-api
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API that uses **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **Gemini Flash** to answer natural-language questions about UCLA clubs.  
It converts CSV data into vectorized documents, retrieves the most relevant entries, and generates contextual answers using Gemini.
**Test with:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://ucla-clubs-rag-api-980752141572.us-central1.run.app/ask" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":"I am a freshman student. Can you recommend some UCLA clubs?"}'
```



## Data Source

The application uses cleaned and processed data from the UCLA Student Organizations database: https://community.ucla.edu/studentorgs
Note: The data is webscrapped on April 27, 2025, so the data might be different while you seeing now. (You can refer the folder '/code/webscrapping.ipynb' in this repo.
